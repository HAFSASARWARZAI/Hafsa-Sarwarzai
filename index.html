	  <p> The diagram shows how the effect of one single persons actions leads to a bigger cause, the white cop accuses the young black boy of stealing and is beating
		 him up because of his skin color this single incident then leads to many more things such as racism, division between races, hate against different races
		 because the the other race thinks it is better than the other race.

	  <h2>"MakeCode Program"</h2>
	  <img src="Code-lighting.png" alt="Animation Lighting" width="450">
	  <p> The following code below is the code we made using a website called "Adafruit" we used that code to make lightig for our scenes while we were recoding.
		The font color when it states light is light blue so thats the color of the light that we used or our scenes, the brightness is set to 255-index, and it
		  is put on function forever, and then on second part of the coding everythn else is the same except the light pauses at 20.
              </P>
